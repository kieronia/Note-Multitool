Note multitool...

I've wanted to make something like this for a while...

When zoony1337 bought out their menu gui - navmenu - I thought I'd have an attempt at it

https://github.com/zoony1337/NavMenu - Use it here - very interesting to play with!


If someone can help me with the throwbin stuff it'd be greatly appreciated!

Please use this responsibily - if you make repetitive requests it'd be against the tos, this is a demonstration project and your actions are not my responsibility!
