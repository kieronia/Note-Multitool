# Notepad-Multitool-
note multitool
I've wanted to make something like this for a while...
When zoony1337 bought out their menu gui - navmenu - I thought I'd have an attempt at it
https://github.com/zoony1337/NavMenu - Use it here - very interesting to play with!

If someone can help me with the throwbin stuff it'd be greatly appreciated!
